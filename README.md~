# Udacity's Machine Learning Nanodegree Projects
This repository contains projects assigned by Udacity in their Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree course. There are 5 projects in total.
## 1. Titanic Survival Exploration
This project explores data to estimate the survival rate of passengers on the Titanic ship. This project uses bare data manipulation without any high-level algorithm.
Framework Credits: Udacity
## 2. Boston Housing
This project focuses on estimating housing prices in Boston using Decision Tree Regression. An optimal model is also found by performing a Grid-search cross-validation over certain parameters of the regression model.
Framework Credits: Udacity
## 3. Student Intervention
This project demonstrates understanding of Supervised Classification. Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree Classifier and Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifiers have been explored. A grid-search cross-validation is performed for the SVM and the optimal model's performance was noted.
