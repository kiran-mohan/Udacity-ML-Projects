    "**Answer: ** \n",
    "\n",
    "Three supervised classification methods that are appropriate for this problem are as follows.\n",
    "1. Support Vector Machines (SVM)\n",
    "2. Decision Trees\n",
    "3. Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs are generally used for two-class classification problems. They are used when the data is linearly separable in some dimension. Linear separability can be induced by using Kernel functions which increase the dimensionality of the data and if the kernel function is appropriate, would result in the data being linearly separable in the higher dimensional space. The major advantage of SVMs lies in the fact that most data can be made at least reasonably linearly separable using an appropriate kernel function. This means that SVMs can be applied to a large variety of problems. The weakness of SVM is that training is cubic in the size of the input O(n^3). This means that if the dataset is large, SVMs take a very long time to train. They also don't work very well when the data is too noisy. For this problem, the dataset is not huge - there are only 300 training instances which means that we can expect good performance out of the SVM classifier without an excessive training time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Trees are good for a variety of classification problems. Decision trees separate the data space into sub-regions across various dimensions to separate out one class from another. Complex decision boundaries can also be obtained from decision trees. A key advantage of decision trees is that they are easy to interpret. They basically implement an if-then-else condition in each node which is understandable to humans unlike other classification algorithms which produce results in an abstract space. As mentioned earlier, highly complex decision boundaries can also be obtained if required. Decision trees also tend to perform well for categorical or discrete input features. The weakness of Decision trees is that they are prone to overfitting. Splitting in decision trees occurs with respect to maximum information gain and this depends highly on the data. Hence, there is quite a high dependence on the data and decision trees might find it hard to generalize well. In this dataset, most of the features are discrete and hence decision trees can be expected to perform well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes classifiers generally work well when the input features are independent of each other. This is because the algorithm makes this assumption of independent features. This classifier is very simple and the training time is linear in the number of inputs O(n). Hence, training is quite fast. The weakness of the Naive Bayes classifier is that it tends to perform poorly for inputs with features that are dependent on each other which happens quite often in real datasets. In this dataset however, there seems to be many features that intuitively seem independent like school, sex, age, address, famsize, Medu, Fedu and so on. The school that the student studies in, intuitively seems independent of the student's gender, age, address, Mother's education, Father's education and so on. Similarly, there seems to be independence between most of the variables with one another. Hence, using Naive Bayes to classify this dataset seems appropriate."

    "With the predefined functions above, you will now import the three supervised learning models of your choice and run the `train_predict` function for each one. Remember that you will need to train and predict on each classifier for three different training set sizes: 100, 200, and 300. Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `clf_A`, `clf_B`, and `clf_C`.\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the results tabulated above, we see that the F1 test scores for the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm are the highest. The decision tree algorithm performs quite poorly because of overfitting. It is evident that the decision tree is overfitting from the F1 training scores for the decision trees which are all 1.00. This means that the decision tree has come up with a solution that fits the data exactly. This overfitting may be reduced by adjusting parameters such as min_samples_split and others. The Gaussian Naive Bayes performs similar to the decision trees in terms of F1 test scores. This may be because of the fact that not all the features are independent of each other. There may be a few features which are actually dependent resulting in lower F1 test scores. For example, travel time and study time may be related with some degree of inverse proportionality. Similarly health and absences may also be dependent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we can infer that the SVM is the best model to pursue given that its F1 test score is the highest and also, the F1 training and testing scores are quite similar while for the other two algorithms, the training score is quite high while the test score is low indicating overfitting. The only challenge with the SVM is that the training time is theoritically large. However, for a small dataset of 300 training instances, this should not cause significant deterioration in speed of training. Hence we expect that the SVM, if tuned appropriately with optimal parameters can result in optimal classifiication performance based on the available data and resources."

    "The Support Vector Machine algorithm draws a linear decision boundary (straight lines or planes or hyperplanes) to separate the data into two classes. In the case of our dataset, these two classes are either the student \"needs intervention\" or \"does not need intervention\". The algorithm computes the position and orientation of the linear separator based on a notion of maximizing the margin. Margin can be defined as the distance between the linear separator and the closest data point in either of the two classes. Hence maximizing the margin means maximizing the distance between the linear separator and the data points of either class. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/svm.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Relating the image to our dataset, if the red squares are students who need intervention and the blue circles are those who don't, we see that the line that separates the data with the highest margin is the solid green line marked as \"Original hyperplane\". In a sense, the algorithm requires fewer training data as only the data near the decision boundary matter. Hence, even though our dataset contains just 300 data instances, SVM seems to be performing a good job. The filled squares and circles are the data instances that are closest to the hyperplane and hence, they are the ones that matter to the SVM algorithm. These data instances are called \"Support Vectors\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that a linear separator is used implies that the SVMs can be used only if the data at hand is linearly separable. However, this isn't the case very often. In cases where the data is not inherently linearly separable, we use a \"kernel function\". Such kernel functions add some dimensionality to the data that makes the data linearly separable in that higher dimensional space. For example, if our dataset which has 30 dimensions (columns representing the features) is not linearly separable in 30 dimensions, we can use kernel functions like \"Radial Basis Function\" (rbf) which adds more dimensions such that the data in that higher dimensional space is linearly separable. Once the data is made linearly separable, the basic SVM algorithm is then run on the higher dimensional data which is now linearly separable and SVM finds the linear separator in that higher dimensional space. SVM then uses this linear separator to predict which class any future instance belongs to. For example, in the future, if we give a student's data to the model, the model will be able to predict whether the student requires intervention or not. There are several kernel functions that can be used and even if one kernel function does not work as expected, others can be tried out and the best kernel function for a dataset can be determined."
